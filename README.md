## Lyrics

```

Let not your indecision become the outcome,
Of your entire life, blank and empty of any income.
To the best of lives will the winner take all.
Losing a  lifestyle is the first step, to conquer this formal ball.

Forget dancing to the tune of others,
Regret nothing as you line yourself into a cloud that smothers.
Climb out struggling for oxygen as if each molecule 
was a dream coming closer to a destined vestibule.

So small that you never would have seen it.
If not for the self discovery of a future fit

- add the rest

```
