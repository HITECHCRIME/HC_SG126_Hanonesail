## Lyrics

```

Let not your indecision become the outcome,
Of your entire life, blank and empty of any income.
To the best of lives will the winner take all.
Losing a  lifestyle is the first step, to conquer this formal ball.

Forget dancing to the tune of others,
Regret nothing as you line yourself into a cloud that smothers.
Climb out struggling for oxygen as if each molecule 
was a dream coming closer to a destined vestibule.

So small that you never would have seen it.
If not for the self discovery of a future fit


...become the outcome of your entire life.

let not your indecision become the outcome,
of your entire life, blank and empty of any income
to the best of lives winner takes it all
winner takes it all aye

losing lifestyle is the first step
to conquer this formal ball
this formal ball aye aye

forget dancing to the tune of others
regret nothing as you line yourself 
into a cloud that smothers aye

climb out struggling for oxygen 
as if each molecule 
was a dream coming closer 
to a destined vestibule

So small that you never would have seen it.
If not for the self discovery of a future fit

- add the rest

```
